# 👋 Hey, I'm Shanu Tiwari

Hey there! I'm [Your Name], a frontend engineer who lives for pixel-perfect interfaces, seamless user experiences, and web apps that are fast, accessible, and a joy to use.

I believe the little details aren’t just details — they’re what make a product feel intentional, inclusive, and alive. Whether I'm refining a micro-interaction or optimizing performance, I pour that same care into every line of code I write. .
